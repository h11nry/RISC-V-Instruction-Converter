RISC-V Instruction Converter is a tool that may help a LITTLE BIT for the developer of RISC-V. Maybe the essential job it does is quite simple and naive. Maybe it can be easily achieved by some online websites. But I believe this tool may eventually help somebody, not matter in quick conversion or learn the functions, structures, binary and hexidecimal forms of instruction. Thank you for your visiting :)))

## Features

- #### Auto Filling: This tool will help you fill some fixed blocks when using instructions, such as optcode, func3, and func7
- #### Decimal Input: No need to remember or convert the number of register from decimal (your brain) to binary (instruction). Just type in decimal, and program will do it for you
- #### Output File Selection: You can select Excel or CSV file to store your conversion result
- #### Auto Save: When the switch of auto-save is on, every time you click "Convert" button, the program will save current BIN and HEX results for you to a result file, as well as current instruction type
- #### Hints and Description: For every specific type of instruction, the program will tell you what is the function, what data should you consider and input, and how to write the instruction comment
- #### Bilingual and Save your eyes: Switch between English and Chinese; Light mode and Dark mode
